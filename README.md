## Modules

- **Registry**: this module deals with the registries available in dappnode: `dnp.dappnode.eth` and `public.dappnode.eth`. Where `dnp` is handled by dappnode organization and `public` is available for everyone who wants to publish their own package. This module uses the Graph among other things to search for the events emitted by each Smart Contract Registry: `NewRepo`. The registry module allows you to fetch all the dappnode packages under each registry, then using the module Repository, it could be fetch all the dappnode packages releases assets.
- **Directory**: this module deals with the Dappnode Directory smart contract used to define the dappnode packages available in the dappstore for either `dnp` and `public` dappnode packages. This smart contract define the whitelist of dappnode packages as well as its position and the featured index.
- **Repository**: this module deals with the repository Smart Contract that each dappnode package ENS resolves to. This module allows to fetch ipfs hashes based on versions provided, as well as resolve these ipfs hashes given an IPFS url. Furthermore, it allows to use either IPFS gateways and APIs, with content trust verification for IPFS gateways (with `dag`).
- **Typechain**: inside this module there are the Smart Contract types created with typechain and the compiled Smart Contracts by truffle. It allows to have types for the smart contracts using the ethers library.
